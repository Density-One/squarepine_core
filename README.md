# SquarePine JUCE Modules

An assortment of modules that make a great addition to your JUCE app and plugin development tool belt.

# License

The current license is ISC.

Mind you, we'd rather something that requires you to not hide away and privately modify the code. And I'd rather issues and concerns be brought directly here. Till then, I'd appreciate any contributions flowing back this way!

# Library Goal

Generally speaking, the point of this library is to provide an assortment of loosely related or unrelated JUCE-based tools, audio or GUI or otherwise, that you can pull up at any given time - and preferably with limited hassle. It should "Just Work TM" with your JUCE project (assuming you're using the latest `develop` branch of JUCE).

The philosophy of this code is multi-part:

* Open up as much code as possible.
  * Have a look at the license! 
* Make the said code as generic and flexible as possible.
* Make the code as consistent in design, architecture, and style, as much as possible.
  * Have a look at our coding standards!
* Easy to integrate.
* Create a tiny community surrounding the features.
  * More eyes on the code and more projects using the code will help reorient some designs, with hope of making things generally better.
    * Better is subjective, of course; it could mean easier to read, easier to use/integrate, just more performant, etc...

There's no secret sauce here, and limited to no sorcery.

We don't care to give ourselves or others more mental overhead - just drop this stuff in and be on your way.

With that, we find that dealing with vastly different coding styles, different architectures, different design patterns, and whatever else, to be **exhausting**. So, this repository attempts to make it all fairly consistent, all the while using the same integration strategy (ie: following the JUCE module format).

If you get snagged by anything then let's openly have a look. Got suggestions? Let's have a look. Just make a GitHub Issue, a Pull Request, whatever works. All that we ask is that you try to get on board with the coding standards as best as possible.
