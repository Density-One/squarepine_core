# SquarePine JUCE Modules

An assortment of modules that make a great addition to your JUCE app and plugin development tool belt.

# License

The current license is ISC.

Mind you, I'd rather something that requires you to not hide away and privately modify the code. And I'd rather issues and concerns be brought directly here.

# Library Goal

The philosophy is to open up as much code as possible and create tiny community surrounding the features. There's no secret sauce here, and limited sorcery.

I don't care to give myself or others more mental overhead - just drop this stuff in and be on your way. Dealing with vastly different coding styles, different architectures, different design patterns, and whatever else is **exhausting**. So, this repository attempts to make it all fairly consistent with the same integration strategy.

Generally speaking, the point of this library is to provide an assortment of loosely related or unrelated JUCE-based tools, audio or GUI or otherwise, that you can pull up at any given time - and preferably with limited hassle. It should "Just Work TM" with your JUCE project (assuming you're using the latest `develop` branch of JUCE).

If you get snagged by anything then let's openly have a look. Got suggestions? Let's have a look. Just make a GitHub Issue, a Pull Request, whatever works. All that I ask is that you try to get on board with the coding standards.
