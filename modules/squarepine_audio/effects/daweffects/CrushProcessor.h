/// TODO: It seems like this effect is a combination of distortion (bit reduction?) and
/// short delay. The delay appears to increase from 0 samples of delay (knob at center)
/// to ~10 samples of delay when turned all the way left or right. When turned to the left,
/// it seems to do something like a flanger (white noise input). Low-frequencies pass through
/// when knob turned to left, likely delay/wet path has positive amplitude. When turned to the right,
/// low frequencies are reduced, likely delay/wet path has negative amplitude. Amount of distortion
/// also increases as the knob is turned away from center. It is difficult to measure the bit depth amount
/// because the distortion seems to only be applied to the wet path, which causes an interesting sweep to
/// output signal.
//  Extra parameter knob also appears to impact the delay time with a similar range as the Color knob. It does
/// not appear to have an impact on the filter. In the sound examples captured, the HPF is active when the extra
//  parameter is at a minimum. There is not a filter that appears active in the other direction (Color = counter CW)
//  while the extra parameter is at minimum.


/// TODO: Gate/comp effect. Knob at center, no effect. Knob to left = gate. Right = comp.
/// The knob "parameter" for the effect appears to control a "hysteresis" type characteristic of the effect.
/// The knob does not appear to simply adjust the threshold, rate, attack, or release. Rather, the gate and
/// compression to be dependent on the rate of change for the gain reduction. For instance, on the gate, if
/// a test tone sine/square wave is input, the gate will allow it to pass through at almost any level if you
/// leave it at steady-state. However, the gate will cut off the signal if it drops in amplitude relatively
/// quickly. This happens even if the sine wave is at 0 dBFS and drops down quickly to -15 dBFS. At this same
/// knob setting, if a sine wave is input at -30 dBFS, the gate will eventually allow it to go through. Therefore,
/// it seems like the gate is program-dependent and adjusts relative to the long-term level of the input signal.
/// The signal only gets cut-off when a rapid decrease in amplitude happens. It appears the compressor does a similar
/// thing, only in an opposite direction. I suspect that the gate/comp was implemented this way so that it would behave
/// consistently for a wide range of input signals (some that have been mastered and so at a much lower LUFS).
